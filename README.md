# antidist

What is antidist?
this repository, antidist, is one I'm using for an easy-access ban system for my games.

*Yes, you can publicly see who is banned in my games.*
> Whether they are exploiters, predators, etc. I will add a sorting system in the future to help those clean up their games.
> Possible integration with Ruben Sim's database of Roblox predators in the future.
